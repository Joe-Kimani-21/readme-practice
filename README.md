## Description

Project is a description of Joseph Kimani. Included is a section About him, A list of Hobbies and Interests and a quote.
The app also includes pictures in relation to each section mentioned

The application is mainly based on HTML and CSS, because they are easy to use, easy to understandand web design languages.
They also build the basics of web design and are quit handy as junior developer.

## Challenges and upgrades

Lack of enough content to include in the project, although the project objectives were met.
Diversify my content with time.
Limited exposure in development hence designed a basic HTML, CSS web page.
With the continued software development training, i intend to diversify on the layouts and general design.
